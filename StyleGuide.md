## Introduction

This style guide is called **Writer's Block**. The objectives of **Writer's Block** are:
- to make content as consistent as possible
- to make writing questions and answers efficient

This is a good cheat sheet if you are lazy or aiming at consistency. These are suggestions and not rules. Tweaking, variations, and some creativity are welcomed. But your compliance is encouraged.

## Question construction

### Question form

#### Whenever possible, write questions instead of incomplete statements.
***What does the `echo` function do on line 3?***
</br>
instead of
</br>
***On line 3, the `echo` function:***

#### Statement form
When it is unavoidable to write in statement form, end the statement with a colon <code>**:**</code>. 

#### Problem construction

The first sentence describes the skill being tested.
</br>
***Write a program that computes the quotient of two floating point numbers.***

#### These are the common constructions for single choice questions

***Which statement [condition]?***
***Which statement best describes the error on line 3?***
***Which statement correctly describes the error on line 3?***

#### Multiple selections

These are the common constructions for questions that require multiple selections

***Which statements [condition]?***
***Which statements correctly describe the error on line 3?***

#### Verbs
